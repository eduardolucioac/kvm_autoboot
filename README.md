The KVM_AutoBoot is a service (bash script) that boots your KVM's VMs (virtual machines) at your server's boot.

Currently KVM_AutoBoot is only compatible with CentOS 7, however adjusting it to work with other distros will be simple.

**NOTE:** The KVM_AutoBoot uses libvirt.

**IMPORTANT:** My life, my work and my passion is free software. Corrections, tweaks and improvements are very welcome (**pull requests** 😉)! Please consider giving us a ⭐, fork, support this project or even visit our professional profile (see [About](#about)). **Thanks!** 🥰

INSTRUCTIONS:
----------------------------------

  The KVM_AutoBoot is a service that boots your KVM's VMs (virtual machines) at your server's boot.
  
  The KVM_AutoBoot's service is started during server's boot after the libvirt's service ("libvirtd.service") starts.
  
  After booting all the VMs defined in the BOOT_ORDER list - configuration file "/usr/local/kvm_autoboot/conf/conf.bash" - respecting the boot's interval defined for each one, the KVM_AutoBoot's service ends. If there are no VMs defined in the BOOT_ORDER list, the KVM_AutoBoot's service stops immediately.
  
  To cancel installation at any time use Ctrl+c.

  > USEFUL INFORMATION:

    To configure KVM_AutoBoot...
        vi /usr/local/kvm_autoboot/conf/conf.bash
    
    Installation Log...
        vi /usr/local/src/kvm_autoboot/installation.log
    
    KVM_AutoBoot's executable bash script...
        /usr/local/kvm_autoboot/kvm_autoboot.bash
    
    KVM_AutoBoot's service logs...
        /var/log/kvm_autoboot/*
```

... press "q" and the installation will be complete.

**Configure KVM_AutoBoot**
  
Open the configuration file...

```
vi /usr/local/kvm_autoboot/conf/conf.bash
```

... and in the BOOT_ORDER parameter inform which VMs (virtual machines) should be booted at server boot...

```
BOOT_ORDER=("VM_NAME0" CUSTOM_INTERV1 "VM_NAME1" CUSTOM_INTERV2 "VM_NAME2")
```

NOTE: The BOOT_ORDER list - actually a bash "array" - should contain the names of the VMs in the desired boot order and the interval to be used before each VM in the sequence (in seconds). The first VM in the list will be initialized with the service and the others after the interval defined immediately before their name. If the interval is set to "-1", the default interval (BOOT_DEF_INTERV) will be used.

To test - **if you want** - start the KVM_AutoBoot service with the command...

```
systemctl start kvm_autoboot.service
```

**NOTE:** The service will stop after starting all the VMs in the BOOT_ORDER list.

**TIPS:**

 I - To list the KVM's virtual machines names...

`
virsh list --all
`;

 II - To check the KVM_AutoBoot's service status...

`
systemctl status kvm_autoboot.service
`;

 III - To track the last KVM_AutoBoot's execution log...

`
cd /var/log/kvm_autoboot/ && less +F $(ls -Art | tail -n 1)
`.
